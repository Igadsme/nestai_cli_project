NestAI – Multi-Agent Adversarial Security Framework for AI-Assisted Development

NestAI is an open-source, adversarial AI security framework designed to validate, harden, and secure developer prompts before they are fed into an AI code generator.
Built in under 48 hours for the KSU AI Club Fall 2025 Hackathon, NestAI won 2nd Place in the AI for Secure Code Generation track for its technical innovation, defense-in-depth architecture, and real-world developer usability.

NestAI is fully functional, open source, and ready to run locally in any IDE terminal.
The only requirement is providing your own OpenAI API key during setup.

Key Features

Safety Gateway
Multi-layer pre-processing and threat screening before code generation.

6-Agent Red Team Engine
Adversarial fuzzing, exploit probing, logic-path manipulation, RBAC checks, injection detection, cryptography analysis, and API misuse detection.

5-Agent Blue Team Engine
Secure rewrites, strengthened constraints, pattern remediation, and generation of hardened output prompts.

Static + Pattern-Based Analysis
Scans for insecure patterns, weak auth flows, misconfigurations, and OWASP-aligned security gaps.

Iterative Risk–Tradeoff Refinement
Developers can accept, modify, or reject risk tradeoffs with full control over constraints.

Developer-First CLI Orchestrator
Run NestAI with a single command from any IDE terminal for fast, secure, production-ready results.

Installation & Setup

NestAI can be run locally in any IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, Cursor, IntelliJ, Sublime, Fleet, etc.) using your terminal.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Igadsme/nestai_cli_project
cd nestai_cli_project

2. Create a Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv


Activate it:

macOS/Linux

source venv/bin/activate


Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

NestAI uses a standard requirements file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add Your API Key

NestAI currently requires an API key for LLM accuracy (during hackathon timeframe).

Create a .env file in the project root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here


Or export it in your terminal:

macOS/Linux

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"


Windows (PowerShell)

setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_key_here"

Running NestAI (Any IDE Terminal)

After installation:

Basic usage
nestai run "Generate a secure login API"


Or using Python directly:

python -m nestai.cli run "Generate a secure login API"

View History
nestai history

Run in Debug Mode
nestai run --debug "Create a secure FastAPI backend"

How NestAI Works
1. Frontend Pipeline

Accepts user prompt

Detects malicious intent

Performs history queries

Outputs tradeoffs

Allows user to approve, reject, or iterate

Sends validated prompt to backend

2. Backend Pipeline

A. Controller Agent
Routes prompt to Red Team, Blue Team, History System, or Gatekeeper.

B. Red Team Agents (1–6)
Each agent performs specialized adversarial analysis:

Authorization

RBAC

Injection

Cryptography

Logic

API misuse

C. Blue Team Agents (1–5)
Each produces a hardened version of the prompt with remediation.

D. Controller Agent Merges Results
Returns a final secure, production-ready prompt.

E. Iteration Loop
User decides to iterate or finish.

The entire workflow is represented in the flowchart above.

Roadmap
In Progress

Training our own local ML model to remove dependency on external API keys

Adding automated test suites

Expanding the Blue Team rewrites

Integrating sandboxed exploit simulation

Packaging NestAI as pip install nestai

Future Goals

VS Code + Cursor extension

Threat profile analytics dashboard

Model-agnostic security plugin

Enterprise-grade audit ledger
